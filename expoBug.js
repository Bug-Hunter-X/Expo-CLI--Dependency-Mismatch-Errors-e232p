This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the Expo CLI version and the project's dependencies, particularly with React Native and related packages.  It often manifests as an inability to start the development server or build the app, accompanied by cryptic error messages related to missing modules or incorrect package versions.  The root cause might be outdated packages, conflicting package versions, or even problems with your Node.js or npm/yarn installations.
