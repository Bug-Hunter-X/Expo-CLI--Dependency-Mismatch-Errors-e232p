To fix dependency mismatch issues, follow these steps:

1. **Update Expo CLI:** Ensure you have the latest version using `npm install -g expo-cli` or `yarn global add expo-cli`.
2. **Clean Package Cache:** Sometimes, cached packages cause conflicts. Clear the cache with `npm cache clean --force` or `yarn cache clean`.
3. **Check package.json:** Verify all dependencies are compatible with your Expo CLI version and React Native version.  Consult the Expo documentation and the documentation for each package to find compatible versions.
4. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install them or reinstall them.
5. **Update Dependencies:** If some of the packages are older, update them to their latest versions. You can use `npm update` or `yarn upgrade` for updating existing packages.
6. **Use a lock file:** If you use npm, make sure you are using npm v7 or later which uses the package-lock.json file. If you use yarn, make sure the yarn.lock file is committed and used to reproduce the environment on different machines.
7. **Use the same package manager:** Avoid mixing `npm` and `yarn`. If you start with `npm`, stick with `npm`. Likewise, if you start with `yarn`, continue with `yarn`.
8. **Check for conflicting packages:** Look for any conflicts among dependencies, particularly in cases of multiple packages requiring different versions of the same dependency.  You might need to use package resolutions to force a specific version if conflicts are detected. (Use package.json's 'resolutions' field).

By carefully managing your project's dependencies and keeping everything up-to-date, you can avoid many common Expo CLI errors.
